It offers a wide range of options, from high-end brands to more affordable choices. The food selection is impressive as well, featuring favorites like PS Cafe, Tambuah Mas, and many others. I often visit this mall, especially during my pregnancy and postpartum period. I particularly love the fifth floor, where all the kids' shops are located. There's even a small playground that my child enjoys.",feedback

Paragon Shopping Centre,1,Angie,"Was at Paragon yesterday evening between 6.30-7.30. Visited a Club 21 pop up sale store on level 2. The experience there with the so call salesperson wasnâ€™t good. The store was selling most brands from Club 21 were slashing prices up to 70- 80 percent discount. I asked to reserved a pair of shoes in the afternoon and put at the counter as I need to rush off to meet clients. As a salesperson myself, this service given to me was below standard. Club 21 is a respectable company in Singapore having this young managers with no respect to customer is very bad. When I went back to buy the shoes, I couldnâ€™t find it, so one lady brought out the shoes and told me itâ€™s sales item, you asked my part time to keep for you she donâ€™t know anything , if we sold the shoes away there is nothing we can do! This sentence , sounds rude to me. She looked down on customers that are buying sales item, if she canâ€™t respect customers that are buying sales item, DONâ€™T GIVE DISCOUNT period.",feedback
Paragon Shopping Centre,2,joel chan,"I'm usually quite hesitant to leave negative reviews but I hope this won't be the experience of others in the future. I was at Paragon today and really needed to charge my phone and when I walked past the concierge I noticed that they had a sign stating that they offer portable chargers. When I went up to ask if I could borrow or rent one, the lady at the concierge didn't even look at me until i paused to wait for her to look up and assumed she was busy even though she already said ""hi"" while looking down. She then told me I had to pay a $50 deposit to borrow the portable charger, which I am completely fine with and understand the need for. She appeared shocked when I said I was fine with the $50 deposit so I just said it again that I was completely fine with it. She continued staring at me and just said ""$50 deposit"" which honestly confused me because she didn't ask me how I wanted to pay and didn't tell me only cash was accepted and repeated it until I asked her if only cash payment was available. I then told her that i didn't have cash and asked if card payment was available to which she replied ""there's an ATM""... I don't carry cash around and that's not her fault but I really think that for a mall like  paragon that the staff, especially at the concierge to have some sort of customer service training. I also think it would be a good idea to allow for card payment for the $50 deposit as many don't carry cash anymore especially if it is advertised at the concierge.",feedback

Paragon Shopping Centre,5,Marklin Ho,"An opulence of peace, quiet and decorum is brought to life here 

I love the atmosphere of this shopping mall because people here seem to be more well-mannered and cordial  less uncouth behaviour like the lazy dragging of shoes / slippers when walking and none of that barbaric â€œschatum schatumâ€ sound when chewing food. Of course, nothing wrong with that if you have such habits as all are born and brought up differently.

Plenty of malls with more relaxed demeanour and bustling with noise which is fine to immerse myself in once a while. However, I prefer peace and quiet if I have the choice and Paragon is highly recommended if you live or work nearby â¤ï¸ or like me, prefer an environment which oozes out such a prized commodity (peace and quiet) in Singapore with ease.",feedback
Paragon Shopping Centre,4,sam Mariella,"PARAGON had been renovated and face-lift   as we see it today.  The facade is beautiful, there is a sense of spacious, be it you stand outside at the entrance, or when you walk first time inside.

At basement, there are midi supermarket. ( Cold storage), restorants ( Ding Tai Fung, LA shrimp, Soup, etc) cafes and booths. I like to stroll at basement. Crystal Jade is at 5 FL.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,Thao Thanh,"Terrible Experience â€“ Do Not Recommend

I stayed 3 nights at Hotel Calmo Bugis and the service was unacceptable. Housekeeping was only done if we specifically asked, the bathroom smelled terrible, and dirty towels and trash were never cleared. When I asked for fresh towels and water, the receptionist said I had to request cleaning, which was never told to us before.

At checkout, they unfairly deducted 10 SGD from my deposit, showing only a photo of a â€œdirty towelâ€ without letting me verify in person. This was dishonest and unreasonable.

Very poor service, hidden policies, and unprofessional staff. I will never stay here again.",feedback

The room stated 22m sqâ€¦ but actually smaller than thatâ€¦ I stay in Indonesia 18m sq room are bigger than theirsâ€¦3.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,,johnmS9898FE,Stay here at your peril. Total scammers .|The accommodation to start is as basic as it comes. No insulation so any noise from other rooms can be heard constantly.Sheets are old and threadbare same as the towels.|But if by some chance you leave the slightest stain that could easily be washed out on either a sheet or a towel you will not get your deposit back.|Charged us $140 because of 3 minute stains 2 on a bedsheet and 1 on a towel .|Whereas some of the sheets had holes in!|Even after we cleaned the stains ourselves with a little bit of warm water they refused to return our deposit. Stating the stains where there so it is in our policy to charge you.|Also ended up with bites from bed bugs as many other reviews have stated.|Disgusting attitude and suffice to say the Manager was the first to state â€˜we are not trying to scam youâ€™|Steer clear or youâ€™ll regret it.,rant
Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,Hotel is in great location. I noticed the night staff at the reception wasn't helpful when you asked for something. The room was good but the toilet would be better if it was so not transparent. I can literally see the person shower. Not so friendly for families. Also the toilet water pressure wasn't that great. Room insulation wasn't great either. But other thank that everything else is good. There's room for improvement for sure.,feedback

However, finding a parking lot is extremely difficult, which can be frustrating for guests driving in. The hotel entrance is not prominently marked, and the lift is located at the back of the building, making access rather inconvenient.The lobby is situated on the second floor and is often overcrowded, giving a cramped and unwelcoming first impression.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,Iâ€™m giving this a poor service as the hotelâ€™s management really did not consider giving me a refund for the booking that I made by mistake. Yes I acknowledge that it was my fault as I booked for July24 instead of June24 but its really clear that it was made by mistake since I was in the actual hotel when I made the booking. I told the receptionist that I just cancel the July24 and book a different one (June24). The receptionist also cant do anything on their end.This was supposed to be just an extension of our stay as we dont want to be staying at the airport anymore (as originally planned). The hotel really did not consider my request of cancellation refund. Trip was kind enough to give me trip coins for the misfortune.,feedback

As a result, the cousin chose to book another hotel to avoid further issues. The sender is requesting clarification on the hotel's policies, emphasizing that consent was given and adults were present at check-in. They also noted that no manager was available when they called. They didn't stated clearly about the extra fee, underage policy at all when upon arriving basically no one was there at the counter  until another family came in to ask for requiry suddenly a Malay lady appear who seems to be polite but isn't she was the one who give false information and keep wasting time for the guests to check in...worse service and attitude problem receptionist",feedback

Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,"We recently stayed at Hotel Calmo Bugis and had a pleasant experience overall. The hotel's location is quite convenient, being just 300m from Bugis MRT and with a bus station right in front of the building, making it easy to get around Singapore.  One of the highlights is that the hotel is surrounded by plenty of restaurants, though if you're looking for halal food, youâ€™ll need to walk around 600m. Itâ€™s still manageable, but something to keep in mind.  As for the room, we stayed in a quad room,which was decent in size and comfortable for our stay. While itâ€™s not overly spacious, it provided what we needed for a good rest. The toilet was clean, which is always a plus.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,"Absolutely loved our stay here! SG was a sudden family trip so I booked this on a rush last June 5th to 8th. It was our first time in SG and we opted to stay around Bugis. The hotel's location is quite strategic because its near the MRT, 5 to 10 mins walk to Bugis street or Albert Centre, good food and lively neighborhood. We stayed on 6th floor, had an amazing view from our corner room. The room itself is clean and comfy for its price. Clean shower. Maybe the only downside was the aircon, it took quite a long time to cool down the room but it was fine.The staff were kind specially the receptionist, Tricia/Trisha, I don't know how to spell her name, was lovely and very accommodating to us, on our last day the rain was pouring and she offered her umbrella just so we can have our breakfast around the neighborhood and even recommended some spots around.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,5,Settasilp Poonbumphen,"I stayed at Hotel Calmo Bugis from October 14th to 17th, and it exceeded my expectations in many ways. The room was quite spacious for two peopleâ€”it could easily accommodate three, with a king-size bed and a sofa couch. The amenities were more than sufficient, with shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, and an abundance of power outlets (including USB ports). Iâ€™m not sure why there were so many outlets, but it was definitely convenient!

One thing to note is that housekeeping needs to be requested daily, though I found this acceptable. The service overall was good, and both check-in and check-out were incredibly fast and efficient.

The only downside to my stay was the slow internet, which was disappointing. However, I would still recommend Hotel Calmo Bugis for anyone looking for a simple yet fully functional hotel in a great location. Itâ€™s close to Bugis Junction, where you can find everything you need, and thereâ€™s even a fantastic mala buffet near the entrance.",feedback

Theyâ€™ll give you a receipt. Keep it so you can get the deposit back.Evevator was a bit confusing. Just make sure to tap your access card before pressing the floor, and not the other way around.When we entered the room, it was spacious. Industrial design. Can easily lay 3 open luggages. Theres also a water heater, iron, hairblower, and iron rack, TV, mini fridge, and AC unit.In the shower, there was hot and cold water for both the shower and sink.TAKE NOTE, THEREâ€™S A BIDET! â€” not all hotel in SG have a Bidet. Only a handful actually. And Hotel Calmo Bugis is one of them.The alley adjacent to the hotel are all food stalls so no need to worry about food. Theres also a convenience store at the other end.

The doorknob had issues when we were there, so we were instead issued the room's master key (which apparently was their only copy, so when housekeeping was requested, the staff couldn't go into the room :)))).

Basically there were issues that even us flexible guests found a bit bothersome that definitely had a dent in our experience while staying. Although there are some good things: bathroom was clean and spacious, good location (a lot of sightseeing spots are very near).

They donâ€™t have any hanger rack on the bathroom so your new clothes or bath towel no place inside of the bathroom. You have to go outside with your roommate nude to get your new clothes and bath towel. Sink are lightly clogged too. We also asked for new coffee cup and additional cup and they said, thereâ€™s no extra cup. OMG! So how to we clean our used cup?? So I let them to wash our used cup but the man who washed our cup do the angry face with us, bad look with us which is so rude. So for me, this place is a big NO. I wonâ€™t comeback on this hotel.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,Mark Heng (Infosphere),"Visit date: 11 Mar 2025
Actual rating: 3.5*

*Taking into account value for money

I was here a few weeks ago (and drank teh tarik siu dai), didn't know this is a Srisun Express outlet 

Now I'm back to eat Indian rojak for breakfast....

Had wanted to try the ""famous"" prata at this HDB block (681) but decided to pass as #MHTamChiak isn't too keen on crispy (but super oily) kosong (no matter how good the curry is) 

They have prata here as well, but no hurry to try as I've eaten at Srisun (Sgoon Gdns) before -- I expect a similar standard (though I think it had gone down quite a bit over the years ).

I checked if they had to re-fry the rojak pieces, as I'd rather not have them oily. Too bad, they had to as some items are actually not fully cooked!

So there went the cuttlefish, deep fried till it had a ""skin"". Definitely not to my liking as it destroyed the texture 

Otherwise, the rojak pieces are rather fresh, as can be seen with the tau kwa 

Potato, small fish cake and plain dough ball were also very good 

So next time I'll just leave out the cuttlefish lol

The gravy is light and hardly contained peanuts!? It tasted slightly spicy, which really went well with the rojak. Usually I will have to ask for another serving... and so I did! 

Strangely, they weren't generous with cut cucumber -- a staple that's great to dunk into the gravy -- and green chilli.

Overall, this was a satisfying and full breakfast. Complete with the requisite teh tarik, of course 

But at $9.90 for this meal -- tea alone is 2.40! -- I'm not keen to return as there are other wallet friendly places to enjoy good rojak!",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,Gavin Koh,"Priced a little too expensive food for a heartland store. My order was $9.40 for 2 egg pratas and 2 teh tariks whereas I could have paid only $6.40 elsewhere.

The scan-the-QR-code-and-order menu wasn't working that well; it was very laggy or seemed to have hung. Even the waitress came to confirm whether I had ordered correctly (after I managed to get it to work on my phone... by patiently waiting). The waitress probably anticipated problems with ordering.

At least the food was hot and arrived quite fast, but the prata looked rather small, as if less dough was used; curry was just enough and quite tasty and slightly crispy. The teh tarik was OK, nothing spectacular.

Sorry, price point is what fails here and it's not as if the ambience was helping much. Sure, it felt breezy enough with the fans going at full blast. But, it's a no from me.",feedback

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,4,Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),"Newest Indian Mamak stall in Hougang. Located in the corner beside cross junction traffic. Very spacious and well decorated, quite comfortable and cossy seating near the roadside.

They serve full Indian menu from Prata, Dosai to Rojak, Briyani to all stir fried comfort foods and of course all traditional drinks.

First, we try their Indian Rojak, very crispy and quite fresh fried stuffed. Dipping potato chilli gravy was not bad too.
We also tried their Dosai, just the plain one, taste was good unfortunately not so crispy and dipping sauces was slightly not to plain, lack of flavours.

In the other day, we take away 2 pieces of grilled Naan bread, wow, it was very fluffy, fragrance, and delicious. Slight sweet and savory taste. Veylry well balanced flavors. Unfortunately, 2 pieces cost $5.50 was too expensive, it was only a plain bread without filling.

On my third visit, trying new dishes, instead of plain thosai, this time I try masala thosai, which is potatoes fillings, very delicious, worth my first try. Yummy.

Another new dish was a fried Bee Hoon with tandoori chicken set, price at $13 each. You have option of the carb, either Fried Rice, Mee, Bee Hoon, Kway-Tiao or Maggi Mee. It was delicious, especially my fried Bee-Hoon, is moist and not oily, and full of wok-hey. Tandoori chicken is yummy but slightly dry inside, can be better.

Overall, I do recommend this Indian stall to all, due to it tidy, clean, comfort and cossy atmosphere. Foods was not bad, table and chairs and environment was clean too, unfortunately, price was slightly high for me. Nevertheless, try it especially if you never visit.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,5,Avriel Peter,"Canâ€™t believe what I just ate! Such fantastic indian cuisine. Ive been travelling around trying different indian food, and even had 3 friends from india teaching me how to eat poori, naan and all sorts of interesting food yesterday. Decided to try Sri Sun today since it is close to my home.

The cost is really good. Higher than other places, but the value was so much more! Eg the poori came with a wholesome amount of potato filling. My nasi briyani was placed beautifully with tender succulent chicken. The curry is thick, savoury, and very flavourful.

Environment is ok. We had 7 pax, which they could handle, but 8 would not cut it unless you want a separate table.

Nitha helped us most of the time, and could explain even more on each dish (yes, we were adventurous and wanted to add some food we have not yet tasted).

Every dish that I often travel around trying, was cooked to perfection (I dare say better). Generosity from drinks to food and sauces made the meal joyful and fulfilling.

I am coming back for sure!

Couple of things for improvement:
1. Papadom was soft and hence hard to eat.
2. Needs cooling. An internal aircon or something that can cool down the place.
3. More sitting areas for 8-10pax.

Ill be sure to make a special request on #1 to be done right the next time I visit. ",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,5,Richie H.,"Simply delicious! I don't understand why the low rating.
The Indian rojak was served hot and super crispy. The sauce was tasty. The coin prata with the mutton set is superb.
The staff were extremely polite and patient when I was browsing through the extensive menu.
The shop is nicely decorated, very clean and hygienic. The staff cleaned and sanitized the tables and chair after each use.",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,5,Elijah Tan,"Looking at their past reviews, I must say that maybe I was just lucky as my experience was not bad at all.

The food and drinks we ordered were delicious and were just as we expected.

Service-wise; the staff were proactive and friendly, especially one of their lady staff.

Highly-recommended!",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,Neko Onna,"Price is slightly on the high side. We ordered Butter chicken curry which cost $8 and you wouldn't believe the size of the thing, it was tinyyy (palm sized) and we were joking bout bringing the bowl home to make it worth our while. It was good and spicy but the size of the bowl was v disappointing. Prata wise, it's definitely not as good as al falah just rite down the road. We also ordered tissue prata, which was like a huge tower, this one wasn't too bad but it did cost about $7. Mee pattaya was also not bad but nothing great

Overall, everything there isn't too bad but prices seem to be on the high side.",feedback

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,FRan,"The masala tosai presentation was good. 4 diiferent varieties of the sauces. Overall it was delicious. But there is a higher price to pay at $4.5. Compared to many places, usually is around $2.5 to $3.5.

Ordered a piece of plain Plata $1.40. Here this stall accept 1 piece. Most stalls minimum you have to order 2.

Wasn't crowded compared to the one 100m away. More airy here and not stuffy.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,1,Sakthi Velu,A new outlet which was opened a month ago only . However place gives you a  good atmosphere but not the food. They had scan your order QR system which was slightly laggy. Payment has to be made upon ordering. When I made my order under the remark I requested for fish gravy but it came out differently. Gravies are not served hot .The impossible prata was not worth a try. Drinks requested for less sweet and mentioned on the remarks but wasnâ€™t taken into consideration. Just walk down straight from this shop to Al falah they serve better quality of food.,feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,Jia Jia Chen,"I visited Srisun Express today, and I have mixed feelings about my experience. On the positive side, the ambience was pleasant, and the restaurant maintained a clean environment. However, I was disappointed with both the food and the service.

We placed our order at 9 am, but unfortunately, they missed out on our plain prata, which left us waiting until around 9:55 am to receive it. This delay was quite frustrating.

Moreover, the honey lemon drink we ordered didn't meet our expectations. It was overpriced and tasted more like plain water with a hint of honey rather than the refreshing lemony flavor we were hoping for. Even my kids, who are usually fans of honey lemon, were disappointed and refused to drink more than a sip.

As for the food, the nasi goreng kampong was noticeably salty, which made it less enjoyable.

In the end, our meal for two adults and two kids cost us approximately $28.85, and considering the average food quality and the service hiccup, I can't say it was a particularly satisfying dining experience at Srisun Express.",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,1,K C LIM,"Scan was not smooth at all!  So ordered from the counter.  Despite few customers, service was slow.  Roti prata was not warm, masala chicken was curry chicken, mee goreng was tasteless and only teh tarik was good.",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,4,Makan Thoughts,"Srisun Express on Hougang Ave. 8 has been a hidden culinary gem, offering a delectable variety of fusion dishes bound to satisfy any craving. One dish that truly stood out during my visit was the Mee Goreng with Chicken Tikka and Prata.

The Mee Goreng, a quintessential Malaysian dish, was flawlessly executed at Srisun Express. The noodles were stir-fried to perfection, carrying a deep smoky flavor with a hint of spiciness. What made this particular version unique and noteworthy was the inclusion of tender Chicken Tikka pieces that added an extra dimension of taste to the dish. The flavors were well balanced, and the chicken tikka enhanced the overall savory experience. Unlike other Tikka, this is fresh from lived grill and not in microwave oven.

Accompanying the Mee Goreng was a side of Prata, which turned out to be a heavenly addition to the meal. The prata, with its crispy yet soft texture, was served piping hot and paired perfectly with the savory flavors of the Mee Goreng. It was truly a match made in culinary heaven.

The portion size was generous, ensuring that I left the restaurant feeling completely satisfied. The prices at Srisun Express are also quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of food served, making it a great value for money dining option.

The staff at Srisun Express were friendly and accommodating, providing excellent service throughout my visit. The restaurant itself has a cozy and casual ambiance, perfect for enjoying a delightful meal with friends and family.",feedback

This was particularly inconvenient and exhausting, especially for families with young children or elderly members.3. **Poor Staff Availability**: We found it impossible to contact the hotel staff when we needed assistance.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,Francesca Lucy Del Rosario,"BEWARE OF THE FALSE REVIEWS ON THEIR SITE. The reason why they have multiple positive reviews on their site is due to their ongoing promotion where the guests can receive cash back if they leave positive comments.
We stayed here for 3 days from May 30 to June 1. When we arrived at 3 pm to check in, the receptionist told us our room was not yet ready since they only had two housekeepers. What made it worse was the receptionist was unapologetic about it and was even rude to us. She was trying to imply that she was doing us a favor of rushing the housekeepers. Besides us, there were also other guests who had been waiting for 3 hours for their rooms and were given inconclusive responses. In addition to the rude attitude of the staff, the room was not cleaned properly. The room smelled and the linens were itchy.",feedback

Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,Jobelle Ann Ramos,"Take a look at the photos of the rooms, and reduce your expectations by 20x. In person, these rooms look unfinished, cluttered and can barely be called neat.

Looking at the triple room? Decrease your expectations by a further 10x. If they give you the corner rooms, 601 and 605, you'll get a little more real estate than the middle rooms. The double bed is okay, serves it's purpose and can definitely fit 2 comfortably even with a baby in between. The extra bed though, is just a single couch with an ottoman added to the end held together by a fitted sheet. And no it's not one of those plush couches, it's as cheap as couches get.

The bathroom is certainly decent. Sizeable enough with a hot and cold shower. If you're on the plus size of things, the toilet is a bit of a squeeze.

Now for the horror story. Of the 3 days we spent in this hotel, we were only able to use the elevators, twice. Twice! And we were on the 6th floor, a group that had senior citizens and a toddler. so to cap off every day of adventure, we had to go walk up the stairs to the 6th floor. We didn't even complain about it anymore, not allowing it ruin our vacation.

The day before were to depart, we gave them a heads up to let them know that we had 13 pcs of luggage between all of us and that at no point were we bringing these down the stairs ourselves. We gave them advanced notice so that they could make arrangements for this. The receptionist even tried to say they would ""help"" us carry the bags down, but we were clear to her that we would not carry 1 bag down. We were clear that they needed to carry all 13 down.

We were travelling with a toddler, and family who were in their late 40s and 50s and who all had their own share of aches and pains. We did not want to risk anyone getting injured carrying these heavy bags down flights of stairs.

Day of departure came, and they did not arrange anything. The receptionist did nothing at all to prepare, and had to carry some of the bags herself and had to wait for another staff to carry the heavier bags. we checked out at 9 am and this whole ordeal ate into our last day which was supposed to be spent enjoying more of Singapore. We were finally able to leave the hotel at 11 am,

This is on top of arriving at the hotel with their receptionist engaged in a shouting match with another group of tourists who were having problems checking in themselves.",feedback

I wasn't in the mood to argue so I took it. Yesterday, I visited again as I ran out of rice at home and didn't want to grocery shopping and then cook after that. I arrived at 7.10pm, I ordered via the paper form and waited over 20 mins for nasi ayam tambah. Something that is not even cooked to order. When the food finally arrived, they give me chicken wing part with so many bones. Whats the point of paying for top up chicken if I'm given bones only??? Slow service and subpar food. I'm gonna avoid this outlet at all cost from hereon",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,4,Sagamihara,Surprised by the 3.1 stars at time of writing.  We have came here twice - both takeaway & dine in. The lady was very friendly.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,1,Xueting Kimberlyn,"Very bad experience for keep repeating my Remark written on the order slip. Keep repeating to them that I cannot have egg as I have allergies for eggs when we have already written on the order slip. Yet they keep bringing the same plate of noodle with egg and with even more egg fry into the noodle. When approach the chef, give attitude and question me if I written on the paper. So after that the waitress went to check and verify it was written. They seems to have some small argument then the chef started to procrastinate to cook the noodle. Then when the noodle is served, it's also served with a black face waitress who show how unhappy she is when she's the one who indicates wrongly to the kitchen. No apology from any of them when we didn't do anything wrong",feedback

When down to order food ( prata)  n told the cashier that pls donâ€™t give fish curry as allergic and ask to pack dalcha where the cashier acknowledged, after 15 mins my food was ready and before collect I double confirm on the curry as well which staff also confirm that itâ€™s dalcha.

Came house and check it was 2 packet of fish curry! Call them to inform the staff just say SORRY!

What kind of service you providing ? We not getting food for free! We paying for our food!

Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,Tran Tran,"The room was very dirty and unclean when we first came in. All the pillows and the beddings were worn out, smelly, stinky. The room was dusty. They did change the beddings upon our request but it was still smelly and itchy due to being worn out. They did not clean the room, take out garbage or provide toilet paper during our 2 nights. The 3rd bed was also just a sofa, not a bed.

Don't trust the 5 star ratings, this hotel paid for it. We will not stay here again or recommend it for anyone. Truly disappointed for such a hotel in Singapore.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,"During my recent stay at this hotel, I was disappointed by the overall experience. One of the major issues was the persistent unpleasant odor coming from the toilet. It was quite off-putting and made it difficult to feel comfortable using the bathroom facilities. Despite attempts to address the issue with the hotel staff, the problem persisted throughout my stay, negatively impacting the overall ambiance of the room.Another significant drawback of this hotel was its proximity to a noisy bar. The loud music and rowdy patrons late into the night created a constant disturbance, making it challenging to get a good night's sleep. On top of that, the thin walls offered little sound insulation, and I could clearly hear a baby crying from the neighboring room. This added to the noise disruptions and further affected the quality of my stay. Overall, the combination of the smelly toilet and the noise disturbances from the adjacent bar and neighboring room made my experience at this hotel far from satisfactory.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,Simon Lilly,"Avoid avoid avoidâ€¦.

I would not recommend you even think of booking this place. The pictures on the website do look good,  but when we arrived, the experience was something else

The room is not big at all, way too small for 4 people - and was really noisy - the windows didnâ€™t shut properly, they let lots of street noise in.

The room was Hot and took an hour to cool down. Very unpleasant.

The bed was hard and the pillows not comfortable at all.

There was no hot water from the shower in the morning.

Avoid.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,5,Marc Ivan Lanuza,"The hotel was very easy to find.

If youâ€™re coming from Changi, just take the Green Line to Bugis station.

Remember to take Exit D. Although you can take Exit A near Bugis Junction, but thats a 10minute walk. Taking Exit D is only 3 minutes.

Check-in was fast and easy. Just remember to get SGD first since thereâ€™s a 100$ deposit. Theyâ€™ll give you a receipt. Keep it so you can get the deposit back.

Evevator was a bit confusing. Just make sure to tap your access card before pressing the floor, and not the other way around.

When we entered the room, it was spacious. Industrial design. Can easily lay 3 open luggages. Theres also a water heater, iron, hairblower, and iron rack, TV, mini fridge, and AC unit.

In the shower, there was hot and cold water for both the shower and sink.

TAKE NOTE, THEREâ€™S A BIDET! â€” not all hotel in SG have a Bidet. Only a handful actually. And Hotel Calmo Bugis is one of them.

The alley adjacent to the hotel are all food stalls so no need to worry about food. Theres also a convenience store at the other end. Bugis junction and Alberts Hawker are just a few minutes away if you want to save on money for food, or buy souvenirs.

Location overall was great since most places you need to visit in SG are either in the blue or green line, and Bugis intersects both of them.",feedback

There was no one manning the counter the first time we checked in and we had to wait for 15 minutes for the person to arrive.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,2,Royals Capital,"When We stay here on Saturday, it was pleasant.
The room is not that big as like other Singapore budget hotel. Itâ€™s like an apartment studio. Thereâ€™s microwave and pantry on the 2nd floor. The location is quite strategic, lots of resto bars and shopping centre around the area. The hot water, wifi are good. The TV channel isnâ€™t good, only 4 channel works and most channel are blinking. I will give it 4 stars.

Yet, when We come back to the hotel 4 days after that, the reception girl accused Us that we broke the toilet cups and We must pay for $20. Offcourse We donâ€™t want to pay as they have no prove that We broke it 4 days ago. We already put $100 deposit for each room, and when We check out 4 days before the reception said everything is good. This is the first time We had an experience like this.
What happen if We didnâ€™t come back to that Hotel, how are you going to charge us?

The reception said She called her boss, by the way she doesnâ€™t called in front of us. She then come back and said the boss will waive the broken cups and if itâ€™s happen again they will charge Us for $100. When we check out, the reception check our rooms and we offer to check it together, but she doesnâ€™t want as she said it was the procedure.

Hey boss, if you read this you better learn about hotel management and customer satisfactions. If you argue to your customer, even though you win, yet you still lose the customer.

For other customer that want to stay in this hotel, make sure you make a unboxing room video, as they might accuse you broke something and take advantages. Another tips, ask to get new linen and pillow case, as Iâ€™m sure they didnâ€™t change to a new one when the customer before you check out. We stay here 2 times and booked 3 rooms, and all the linen and pillow case stinks. Do you itâ€™s a coincident? We donâ€™t think so.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,kristen sison,"Everything was extremely terrible except for the location of the hotel. The room was very worn out, small (lied on pictures and booking) and a lot of the furniture and bathroom tools were broken. All the bed and bathroom related things (pillows, linens, covers, sheets, towels) were all soiled and so worn out from previous guests you can see various stains and chipping or breaking. When we asked for room cleaning and replacement of pillow cases and bed linens and towels, we were only given pillow cases and towels as they were having issues with their external laundry service and the housekeepers donâ€™t clean the rooms at all even though theyâ€™re supposed to be cleaning all rooms at 5pm. As the front desk staff also seemed troubled by their housekeepers, we would be the ones going to the front desk everytime we needed new towels, tissue paper and water even though housekeeping should be doing it. Everytime we entered our room again everything was exactly the same, they couldnâ€™t even just sweep the floors as the bare minimum. It also felt really disgusting because you can smell the body odor from the beds and pillows. Their sofa bed is also not a sofa bed at all but just a regular sofa which they cover with a dirty bed sheet thatâ€™s not for the size of the sofa at all. We found various broken things like the lamp, bidet, and plugs which you have to prove that you werenâ€™t the one who caused the previous damage, so be wary and report it to them immediately. Although the location is very good as itâ€™s one of the streets of bugis and thereâ€™s a lot of food nearby, itâ€™s not worth it considering how unacceptable the quality of their rooms and service are. They also have a cash back service where giving them a fake good review would get you back some moneyâ€¦",feedback

And the hotel is not cheap, its not money worth it at all.

You need to tell the receptionist if you want your room to be cleaned. No telephone at room, since this is important actually if we need something or to contact the receptionist.

The receptionist are not friendly at all, rude, no smile, not even greetings you. If you ask questions or request something, they will reply like you are stupid and its like you never stayed in a hotel before.

What we like only the bathroom that is quite spacious, cleanliness just average ( we found some hairs on the bed)

Location is good, but againâ€¦ location good, service is bad, especially the receptionist who should be the one who most friendly and helpful in the hotel were very disappointed.

I'm not sure about the food, because mine never came.
The drink is ok, slightly on the sweeter side.

Arrived and was given the menu quite promptly, but heck, a delusion of ""good service""
It's more like pressing you to order something which, might not come.

Ordered some pratas through a male staff around 11.30 am.

30 mins later, I called him over to checked the status of my order, to which he seemed confused. He repeated my order, and I saw him walking over to another female staff gesturing towards me.

Another 30 mins passed, and my food is still not served, I called the staff over again to check on my order to which he told me ""coming soon"" while going over to inform the kitchen.

Well, another 45 mins went by and my food shows no signs of arriving.

I paid for my drink and left. Never gonna be back again.

Regardless of peak or non-peak, their service standard is the same.

Didnt know vaping was legal here..

Kazokutei,3,Andrew Chwee,"The service is swift, but the menu is slightly complicated. Hard the pork kimchi udon, and it is alright, nothing much to shout about. It came in a big bowl, and we were shocked, but itâ€™s not a lot for one person.",feedback
Kazokutei,2,Say Kiat Tan,"Chicken omu rice is $11.90.

Pork omu rice is $12.90.

Combo (chicken and pork) omu rice is $13.90.

So you would expect combo to be chicken omu rice and then add some pieces of pork or vice versaâ€¦ (refer to photo).

Wait until you see the waiter serving another table their chicken-only or pork-only omu rice! The portion is much much more than what you get with the more expensive combo!

So skip combo if you have the same logical mind like mine!

Disgusted so todayâ€™s visit will be my last there.",feedback
Kazokutei,1,Zack Tan,"Food was so-so. But given the price you pay for it, I can close an eye.

Service and hygiene leaves a tremendous lot to be desired though. Throughout my meal, there was a huge bug flying around and the waiters did not notice it. Fair enough, given that they don't walk around the restaurant much as orders are made via iPads chained to the tables and all they do is bring food to you.

I alerted a waitress to the insect who looked at it, smiled, then walked away without even giving an apology, let alone attempt to get rid of the pest.

My order was the promotional Mentaiko cream udon with California Maki. The mentaiko was bland and the egg served with the udon (which wasn't even the typical runny type normally served with ramen/udon) was cold and unappetizing. Maki was just average. All this set me back by $15.90.

There are at least 2 other Japanese eateries including the restaurant chain Sakae Sushi nearby, if you crave the cuisine. This place is not worthwhile; give your business elsewhere.",feedback
Kazokutei,4,Ikustas Yat,Pretty different from the one in Japan. The food is ok and agree with some reviews its slighlty on the salty side. I gave an extra star coz the service is good.,feedback
Kazokutei,2,Mj Go,The food quality really needs to improve. It's really not that good as it looks. The meat is not fresh it tasted like they just reheat the dishes.,feedback
Kazokutei,5,Din Neo,Excellent taste of Japanese food. Love the ambience. Staffs are friendly and helpful.,feedback
Kazokutei,2,dp,"Portions were tiny. The menu showed the omurice swimming in half a plate of sauce but the actual thing barely had a any sauce on it. The seafood tomyum udon had some small prawns in it, but a grand total of ONE clam SHELL. Without even any clam in it. And the tempura maki looked so sus we didn't even take a photo of it. It's sustenance for a hungry human, but nothing more.",feedback
Kazokutei,5,Roland Seh,Udon in different styles and done well!! Loving the food here! The service is also impeccable!,feedback

Kazokutei,1,megan ho,"Ordered 2 Omu rice with pork and fried chicken combo and paid $16.50 per bowl. This was truly disappointing.

Not only was the wait around 45 minutes, the food did not taste appetising at all. The portion was 50% fries with 2 pieces of fried chicken balls which were rock hard and 3 pieces of pork cutlet. I am pretty sure the fried chicken balls and pork cutlet were frozen food that was microwaved. The curry was watery and diluted and did not taste like curry. Do not recommend this place at all, not worth it.",feedback
Kazokutei,3,kaiser misaki,The food and taste is actually not too bad. But the presentation could be better. Or maybe it's just me?,feedback
Kazokutei,3,Viv N,Food is nice but portion too small.,feedback
Kazokutei,1,Beverley Tan,"One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to, considering I dine out often. The pork cutlet has a weird â€œfrozenâ€ taste, the egg on the one rice is flat, dry and a bit charred, the fries are soggy, the tan tan miso udon is so spicy (???) that it is choking.
Can Google have a negative 5 star ranking framework, specifically just for this restaurant?",feedback
Kazokutei,1,DON MUN,"Food is editable,  could have been better. My only regret is that I did not check restaurant ratings before ordering.  Children set meal not worth. Other customers get their order first even when the restaurant is not fully filled. iMO, go elsewhere. In addition, I need to have psychic power to know whether our food is coming or not, when the waitress did not even respond to our order request",feedback
Kazokutei,3,Billy Ko,Food was mediocre. Took 15 mins to arrive yet it was only lukewarm. Portion was rather small. And they had this 3 steps of stairs down to the seating area where one of the particular steps is a lot higher. Service staff had to constantly remind the guests which on their part is a good move but I do hope it gets resolved soon,feedback
Kazokutei,2,v. lim,"Ambience was okay, not packed but had a decent amount of people for a Friday evening. Food was okay, but took a while to come.

Ordered a main meal + drink and wasn't full, so I had some leftovers from lunch. Was told off by staff, saying that no outside food was allowed, even though I had already finished my main. Would have expected some flexibility, but oh well!

Pretty bummed about the incident, so people who are planning to finish up extra food or cake after your meal, be prepared to be told off.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Dharven Panchal,"Dreamy location if you are in Singapore, a must-visit place. A fun, enjoyable, and exciting day you are going to experience here if you are visiting. One full day is required here.

You have to buy passes in advance. Also, if you can install their application and check the wait time for each activity. For kids, adults, they have a Range of activities. They have introduced Minion Land and kids just love this.

The best ride is Transformers and The Mummy. They also have food stalls available. The Jurassic Park ride is just awesome. Pls bring a raincoat if you are planning for the Jurassic Park ride. Express pass is not required if you are visiting jn off off-season. On Sunday, they have parade.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Hasanain Habasha,"We had a fantastic day at Universal Studios Singapore! I visited with my family and our two kids, and it was truly a memorable experience for all of us. The park is well-organized, clean, and full of exciting attractions suitable for both kids and adults.

Our children especially loved the themed rides and character meet-and-greets â€” seeing their favorite movie characters come to life was a real highlight! The staff were friendly, helpful, and made sure everything ran smoothly.

We also appreciated the shaded areas and rest spots, which made it easy to take breaks throughout the day. There were plenty of food options, and the park was very family-friendly overall.

Highly recommended for families looking to spend a fun-filled day together. Weâ€™ll definitely be coming back again!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,1,Prathi Pranav,"Very very poor management! Didn't expect this kind of response from one of the best world class entertainment park!

Here's the scene-

We visited on a weekday and still wait time for main rides were almost 120mins (2hours), meaning we cannot take more than 3 rides. After spending lot of money and not able to use all the rides is like total waste.

No benefits even on express pass.

Plus some rides come into maintenance, so if someone waited for 1hr but cannot complete the ride. (No ride + time wasted).

Ad- Rides are super awesome , lot of fun.

These are must-
1. Transformers
2. 2 roller coasters
3. Jurassic park
4. Canopy flyer",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Eugene T,We visited on a weekday and not during the holidays or school breaks. It was fairly quiet except for a group of overseas travellers. You can buy the express ticket but only make that selection once you are there and confirm it will be busy. Take your time and spend the full day there so youâ€™re not rushing around. Bring small backpack in case you have to store it during some rides and remember your water and umbrella. There are rides for all ages so lots to go round for everyone and heaps of souvenirs to buy at every sections.,feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Kevin Chavez,"What an amazing theme park. Universal Singapore may be small, but it has so much packed within it. You could easily spend the whole day here and still not manage to do and see it all. This place is fun for the whole family. There are roller coasters, thrill rides, and shows that make the whole experience worthwhile.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Sello,"It was a great experience to visit the resort during the week. The resort was less crowded, which was a pleasant surprise. Singapore is usually known for its hot and humid weather, so I was surprised by the pleasant weather. Access to the resort is easy, as you can take the metro and the Sentosa Express.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Deepak Pant,Nice experience with family. Needs a full day to explore the park. Be prepared for long waiting times sometimes up to 2 hours for a single ride. Buy the express pass if you can afford it. Food is good and reasonably priced compared to other such theme parks. We liked the one in Oasis cafe in the Egyptian section.,feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,ChuLuxe Explorer,"Universal Studios Singapore is a true playground of happiness. Itâ€™s definitely not just for kids. Adults can have a great time too. There are so many fun and exciting rides, but honestly, some were a bit too intense for me. Anything that flips you upside down was a no from me. I preferred just walking around, soaking in the atmosphere, which felt perfect for my pace and age.

One thing to keep in mind is the waiting time. I had to wait almost an hour for some rides. It gets really crowded, especially later in the day. If you want to make the most of your visit, I highly recommend getting the Fast Track pass. It saves you a lot of time and stress. Also, come early if you can. That really helps.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Aurelien Ducos,"We spent a day that we will never forget! Universal Studios Singapore was simply incredibleâ€”undoubtedly one of the best activities to enjoy as a family. The park is full of thrilling rides, immersive worlds, and fun for all ages.

If you can afford it, I highly recommend purchasing the Express Passes. They allow you to skip the regular queuesâ€”which can be 45 to 60 minutes longâ€”and go straight to the rides. It made a huge difference to our experience and let us enjoy so much more of the park without wasting time in line.

A must-do while in Singapore!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Vipin Nair,"The tickets are expensive but itâ€™s worth it. And you require a full day of enjoy all the things to see and go on different rides. With small kids, it may be difficult as many rides are only for taller people, but there is plenty of things for kids as well. Though we went on a weekday, most rides had minimum waiting period of 30-40 minutes. But except the rides; lots of fun activities to do, but rides are a big draw.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,MonoBattery,My first time going USS! The queue was long but it was fast and basically you can do a circle of the place. I rode the Sesame Street's and Revenge of the Mummy's ride. After that mostly took photos because I cannot handle motion sickness. There were restrooms and snacks/drinks placed all around so no fret. Lockers are provided when you need to go on rides that doesn't allow bags/cameras. Check out the shops too!,feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Dward Sealmoy Jr.,One the highlights of our Singapore tour. Clean and afforable. Will definitely comeback. I am also planning to visit all other Universal Studies from around the world.

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Shanuka Rathnayake,"I visited Universal Studios Singapore back in 2018, and itâ€™s still one of my favorite travel memories! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was full of excitement and adventure. Each themed zone was so creative and well-designed, it truly felt like stepping into different movie worlds.

The rides were amazing! I especially loved the Transformers ride and the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. There was something for everyone, whether you enjoy thrilling roller coasters or more relaxed family, friendly attractions.

The park was clean, well-organized, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There were also plenty of places to grab a quick snack or meal, and even the food felt like part of the experience.

Overall, it was a day full of fun, laughter, and unforgettable moments. If youâ€™re visiting Singapore, Universal Studios is a must-do!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,3,Carmelo Distefano,"I had more fun than expected however we paid over AUD 1000 for three kids limited express tickets and two adult entry passes and there were a number of rides closed for maintenance, particularly the Lost World ride which was the only one I was interested in. This should have been advised in advance or the FULL price should not have been charged by the park. Lunch was also difficult to find seating. Overall though the staff were friendly and welcoming and the family had a good time.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,3,Nur Athirah Binte Hussain,"Plan your trip. We went on a Sunday and had to wait at least 45 minutes for each ride. Food was expensive so make sure you guys bring some snacks to sustain during the time in the theme park. On the positive note, Mummy ride and Cylon ride was worth the wait but no belongings during these rides. So you will need to put your things (including phone) in the locker (you will need to pay).",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Allie,"Had a good time at Universal Studios Singapore! The park is full of fun rides and attractions, though it can get quite crowded, especially on busy days. Tickets are on the expensive side, so itâ€™s worth planning ahead. Unfortunately, it was raining during my visit, which made some parts a bit less enjoyable. Still, the overall experience was very positive â€” great for families and thrill-seekers alike. Iâ€™d give it 4 out of 5 stars and would recommend it if you donâ€™t mind a crowd!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Eli Paradise,"Always have the best time at Universal Studios. âœ¨ Compared to Disneyland though, the rides here feel a lot shorter.

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Ameen nigar,"""We had a blast! The kids thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and it was super exciting. However, the queue was very long, and we waited for about 35 minutes. Considering the wait, maybe an express ticket service would be a good idea? The prices were $85 for adults and $65 for kids. Overall, my kids loved it, and it was worth the experience!""

Experss tick need to pay more.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,2,-Obydur Rahman Shazol-,"A very good Theme Park to bring your kids.
However authority should take necessary measures to limit the number of guests inside the Studio as currently you have to wait 45-120 minutes just for a 2/3 minutes ride.
As a result people can not enjoy all the ride and can not roam around the park freely.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Madhuram Sabari,"Universal Studios Singapore was a fun and exciting experience overall. The park is beautifully designed, giving off Disney-like vibes with well-crafted zones, characters, and attractions that are immersive and entertaining.

Every attraction I tried was enjoyable â€” from thrilling rides to themed shows, thereâ€™s something for all age groups. The setups and attention to detail are impressive, making it feel like youâ€™ve stepped into a movie world.

That said, the place is a bit on the expensive side, and one downside was the cloakroom/luggage storage charges, which felt too high for a theme park. (I donâ€™t remember the exact price, but it was more than expected for a few hours of storage.)

Despite that, if youâ€™re in Singapore and up for a full-day adventure, itâ€™s definitely worth visiting once. Just plan your time and budget accordingly!",feedback

Firstly Curry gravy served cold- mini omu rice . Then the worst part 2nd order served pork cutlet curry udon served with a dead housefly below the cutlet when I try to put separate it and i saw a dead housefly on the curry udon.. Luckily I order/asked for no spring onions if not worse the housefly will be hidden mix up ...
Totally making us to puke after seeing it and no more appetite to continue eating both .. Really can't believe a dead housefly can' be served on the curry udon to us..
Plus took long time somehow the service staffs can't even gave proper explanation when feedback given both OR even no apologies given by a single kitchen staff .Shame . .
So we decided to leave the restaurant as it's a waste of time talking to the staffs ..
Pls kindly look into this matter and update on it asap.. thank u
I think it's time to set proper training of the whole management and the staffs of this restaurant in there of handling proper food service and esp the customer service ...
I m really regretted not reading all neg feedbacks here before gg in and order food ..

Kazokutei,3,Zhi Heng,"Food is decent but nothing spectacular or worth travelling for especially cause its on the pricey side. The tempura r decent but have this taste of reused oil. the sweet potato tempura can be softer in texture. N the sauce is too watery n lacking in flavour in my opinion. I had the asari udon which was decent too just that it's a tad too salty for my liking. Serving size was kinda small, wasnt fu after eating. N it would be better if there r more ingredients n garnishes present to make it more aesthetically pleasing and flavourful considering the price. Place is relatively empty even during dinner time. Good thing is that water is provided free of charge tho i feel that a standard drink like hoji tea should have been included in the set meal like most places. Food is decent just that for that price range I would expect much more.

Finally, this staff (supposed manager as he dressed nicer than the other staff) noticed me as I signaled to him if he could come over. To my horror, he shouted across the restaurant ""can you call my other colleagues"" as he does some kind of hand movement to indicate as if ""can't you see I'm already very busy why are you calling me over"".

I felt attacked as a customer and felt disgusted when we had him as our cashier and had to give our hard-earned money to pay for such a service. Maybe he had a bad day, and I can empathize with that.

Servers were not active in filling up tea and take a more reactive then proactive service (always have to request for refills)

Lastly the server lead was like raising her voice to another staff of hers about the work and the entire half of the outlet could hear her. Not professional one bit and cause so much unpleasantries while dining.

To be fair the food was ok but don't expect basic service there and save your 10% service charge on something else. Experience was bad. So not recommended.",feedback

Opened the next piece of chicken to see it was white and pink inside. My friend's omurice chicken one of the pieces were still frozen.

It was a bit disappointing to be honest -- I ordered the chicken wafu and it wasn't very flavorful and didn't come out very hot. Overall just not really satisfying. I also got the fried chicken to go with it, and it wasn't super crispy or hot. It was just...there. The best part of this set was actually the chawanmushi! It was really smooth and silky. Nice job!",feedback
Kazokutei,1,Lim Kino,"waiting half hours eat cool fries,rice and chicken. 4 dollar value",feedback
Kazokutei,4,clare istiredzzz,"The food is fantastic. However, there is a female staff that has an attitude problem. The rest of the staff are kind and patient but that one female staff is just horrible. Talks rudely to me and is really impatient. For that, the place loses one star.",feedback
Kazokutei,1,flappy bird,"Didn't manage to get to sit. So lorsor. Which F&B will check IC or check address just for sit their consumers to sit together even despite the current max 5 pax covid regulations. Then children below 15 how, cannot eat there isit because they don't have IC or any proof that they all live under 1 roof... Ridiculous! Thankful for not eating there having seen the poor reviews of the place. If can give 0 stars i would give negative!",feedback
Kazokutei,4,Farah Nabilah,"I ordered the Kokudashi Soba with Mixed Tempura. Slightly oily, but still good. No queues though, so it's perfect if you're looking for a quick meal.",feedback
Kazokutei,1,V V,"Very salty soup base,  soda drink taste like plain water. Overall not worth it at all even though it is relatively affordable place to dine in.",feedback
Kazokutei,1,Kenneth Kwok,Bugis Junction outlet. Below average for food quality. Customer service minimum. Food freshness questionable. But Covid safety measures were good.,feedback
Kazokutei,1,Haochuan Zhang,"Donâ€™t go

Wondering why the place got not queue, it turns out to be a 2 star reviewed restaurant. Not surprised itâ€™s as described:
1. Dodgy food, not as fancy as the picture
2. Careless staff, toss the spoon on the table
3. Expensive",feedback
Kazokutei,1,Peter Chan,"Food was horrendous,food took way too long charged us 11$ for service charge and did not serve us right came to our table and threw the food had to ask for our sides to come if not they forgot abt it. Donâ€™t waste ur time here save your money go to the opposite side for the food maybe a abit more ex but still so much better and worth to buy food from there all my friends rather eat MCD then some Low serviced food",feedback
Kazokutei,1,G H,"Very slow, waiting about half an hour already and still waiting, although there are only a few tables of customers. If delivery orders is causing long waiting time, should have the courtesy to let customers know. This will be my last time here.",feedback
Kazokutei,2,YeowChong Chuah,Waited 35 mins for a average omu rice. That's after queuing to get in. Edible food just dun come off you are really hungry.,feedback
Kazokutei,1,HANQI WU,One of the waitress is very rude! And the serving speed is really slow! We waited for 40min and the food is still not here yet! Really,feedback
Kazokutei,1,Glenda Tsai,"Atrociously lousy crew service. Served our food roughly and rudely. Staff was clearing the tables noisily, causing irritable din to diners. This is certainly our first and final time there.",feedback
Kazokutei,1,Albert Lee,Doesn't seem sanitary and the oil they use to fry their tempura smells like they have not changed for a bit of time. I would highly recommend avoiding this place.,feedback
Kazokutei,1,Marilyn Tan,"The food was so so. But wouldnâ€™t come back because of the customer service. After I ordered, the staff throw the receipt on the table which I really hated. Like why would he even throw the receipt. There isnâ€™t much people in the restaurant anyway.",feedback
Kazokutei,3,Elsa Zaoputra,Food is average and it took so long to come out.,feedback
Kazokutei,2,Jason Koh,"Cold fries, tasteless fried ebi, tasteless fried chicken, service from staff no standard.
Paying restaurant price for the above is a NO!
Never come again.",feedback
